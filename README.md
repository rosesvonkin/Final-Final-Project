Final Project for Ptyhon Lab 
Hi Pedro! Please note that I am aware I do not really have three distinct figures but I would have included a correlation matrix figure if there were fewer regressors. Also note I am aware that 5 CV folds are not very many but for the sake of processing power I had to limit them. Regardless, thank you very much for giving me extra time to get this in and thank you for another wonderful quarter! I learned alot and I hope you have a wonderful summer.
